# Privacy Policy

- The game "Scrap Squadrons" stores player data locally on the player’s device only. 
- The multiplayer component is a matchmaking server that does not keep persistent player data; it only processes connection messages and may produce short-lived logs for diagnostics.
- The only piece of potentially-personal information that the matchmaking server receives is a Nickname ("Title" in game), which is initially auto-generated, but can be explicitly changed by the user.
- The game does not collect or share personal information with third parties.
